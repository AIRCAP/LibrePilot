# *************** LibrePilot commits guidelines ***************
# Each commit needs to have a message like the following sample:
#  LP-188 Determine AccelTau based on usage
#
# It needs to begin with a reference to one or more Jira tickets followed by a short description.
# If needed add a longer description in the following lines, after an empty line.
#
# Before committing, ensure your code is properly formatted using:
#  	make uncrustify_all 
# You can format flight or ground code only using respectively 
# uncrustify_flight or uncrustify_ground
#
# Naming branch with username and Jira ticket is also a good practice:
# e.g. username/LP-188_Determine_accel_tau
